# FrictionProviders.jl

### [NQCDynamics.jl](https://github.com/NQCD/NQCDynamics.jl) friction connector for molecular dynamics with electronic friction


**This package supports the following models:**

- Full tensorial models based on **orbital dependent friction (ODF):**
  - [ACEds.jl](https://github.com/ACEsuit/ACEds.jl): ACE-based ODF models
  - SchNet-based ODF models
- **Local density friction approximation (LDFA)**-based density models:
  - Density cube files
  - [ACEpotentials.jl](https://github.com/ACEsuit/ACEpotentials.jl)-based density models
  - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)-based models
